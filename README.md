# 3D Gaussian surface reconstrction with diffusion methods
This is preview version of 3d surface reconstruction works
***
## Usage
- two environments required: environment.yaml is for stable diffusion, and environment2.yaml is for 3dgs
- after install all environments required, you run stable diffusion first, after generate style transfered pictures, you load a pretrained 3d gaussian model and combine with style transfered pictures to start surface reconstrcutions.
***
## TODO list
- [] add a 3d vae encoder decode with lora finetune modules
- [] add a pipelin-like bash executable which can let all 3 modules run with only 1 click
